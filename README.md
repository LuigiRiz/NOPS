## Introduction
Novel class discovery (NCD) for semantic segmentation is the problem of learning a model that is capable of segmenting unlabelled (novel) classes by using only the supervision from labelled (base) classes.
This problem has been recently pioneered for 2D image data, but no work exists for 3D point cloud data.
In fact, assumptions made for 2D are loosely applicable to 3D in this case.
This paper is thus presented to advance the state of the art on point cloud data analysis in four directions.
Firstly, we address the new problem of NCD for point cloud semantic segmentation.
Secondly, we show that the transposition of the only existing NCD method for 2D semantic segmentation to 3D data is suboptimal.
Thirdly, we present a new method for NCD based on online clustering that exploits uncertainty quantification to produce prototypes for pseudo-labelling the points of the novel classes.
Lastly, we introduce a new evaluation protocol to assess the performance of NCD for point cloud semantic segmentation.
We thoroughly evaluate our method on SemanticKITTI and SemanticPOSS datasets, showing that it can significantly outperform the baseline.

## News :new:
- 3/2023: NOPS code is **OUT**!:fire:
- 3/2023: NOPS is accepted to CVPR 2023!:fire: Our work is the first allowing the segmentation of known and unknown classes in 3D Lidar scans!

## Installation

The code has been tested with Python 3.8, CUDA 11.3, pytorch 1.10.1 and pytorch-lighting 1.4.8. Any other version may require to update the code for compatibility.

### Conda
To run the code, you need to install:
- [Pytorch 1.10.1](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/)
- [Minkowski Engine](https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine)
- [Pytorch-Lighting 1.4.8](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai) (be sure to install torchmetrics=0.7.2)
- [Scipy 1.7.3](https://scipy.org/install/)
- [Wandb](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart)

## Data preparation
To download the data follow the instructions provided by [SemanticKITTI](http://www.semantic-kitti.org) and [SemanticPOSS](http://www.poss.pku.edu.cn/semanticposs.html). Then, use this structure of the folders:
```
